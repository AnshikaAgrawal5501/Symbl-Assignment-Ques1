### Ingredients
|Item| Quantity|
|---|---|
|Roasted peanuts|2 cups|
|Peanut oil/ vegetable oil|1 tsp (optional)|
|Honey| 1 tblsp (optional)|
|Salt| a pinch|
### Procedure
1. Take two cups of roasted peanuts. If you have not then -
    - Take normal peanuts in a pan and roast them until they turn golden brown and the skin starts to peel off.
    - Or preheat the oven to 350 F and place the raw peanuts in a baking pan. Now bake for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring once or twice during cooking, until the skins become loose and the peanuts are lightly golden.
    - To remove the skin of roasted peanuts completely, take them in the palm and rub. You can also put them in a cloth and then rub it. If the skin is left then it will lead to a slightly bitter taste.
